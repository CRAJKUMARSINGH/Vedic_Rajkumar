“Treat  cursor-baseline  as the architecture base and  replit-baseline  as a feature reference. First create a module-wise diff summary. Then identify features present only in Replit, features present only in Cursor, conflicting implementations, and probable regressions. Propose a merge plan that preserves all business-critical behavior and avoids duplicate logic. Do not edit code until the plan is approved.”

# App Merge Worksheet: Cursor + Replit Versions

## Purpose
This worksheet is designed to help consolidate two app versions—one developed in Cursor and one improvised in Replit—into a single production-ready version without losing important functionality. The recommended working model is to use Cursor as the primary merge/refactor environment and treat the Replit app as a feature-reference implementation during integration.[1][2]

## Recommended Setup

| Area | Recommended choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Primary merge workspace | Cursor | Better suited for controlled, local, multi-file refactoring and codebase-aware editing.[1] |
| Secondary reference app | Replit version | Useful as a fast prototype and as a source of features or UI ideas to selectively port.[1] |
| Diff and merge utility | 3-way diff/merge tool such as Code Compare | Supports file comparison, folder comparison, conflict review, and 3-way merge workflows.[2] |
| Version control | Git branches | Keeps both originals frozen while merge work proceeds in a separate integration branch.[2][3] |

## Branch Strategy
Create and preserve the following branches before any merge begins.[2][3]

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cursor-baseline` | Snapshot of the Cursor app before merge work. |
| `replit-baseline` | Snapshot of the Replit app before merge work. |
| `merge-integration` | Working branch where the final combined version is assembled. |
| `release-candidate` | Final reviewed branch for pre-release validation. |

## Feature Inventory Matrix
Use this table to ensure no business-critical or hidden feature is lost during consolidation.[3]

| Module | Feature | Present in Cursor? | Present in Replit? | Better source | Merge decision | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | Login flow |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Auth | Signup / user creation |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Auth | Password reset |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Data | Database schema / models |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Data | Validation rules |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| API | Endpoints and payloads |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Logic | Core business calculations |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| UI | Main dashboard / home screen |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| UI | Forms and dialogs |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| UI | Reports / exports |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Settings | User settings / preferences |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Notifications | Alerts / emails / messages |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Security | Roles / permissions |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Other | Hidden utilities / edge-case logic |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Merge Rules
Apply these rules throughout the integration effort.

- Keep one source of truth for each concern, such as one auth flow, one data model, one report engine, and one export path.[3]
- Prefer the better architecture from the base app, then port only proven features from the other version rather than mixing duplicate implementations.[1][3]
- Merge in modules, not in one massive AI request, because incremental codebase migration reduces the chance of hidden regressions.[3]
- Validate every merged module before moving to the next one.[3]

## Merge Sequence
Use this order so dependencies are stabilized before UI polish begins.[3]

1. Data models and schema.
2. Backend services and business rules.
3. API contracts and payload compatibility.
4. Authentication and authorization.
5. UI screens and components.
6. Styling and UX cleanup.
7. Reports, exports, and background utilities.

## Module Review Sheet
Duplicate this section for each major module.

## QA Checklist
Use this checklist before moving from `merge-integration` to `release-candidate`.[2][3]

- [ ] All features from the Cursor version were listed and checked.
- [ ] All features from the Replit version were listed and checked.
- [ ] Duplicate features were resolved to one final implementation only.
- [ ] API responses were compared against both older apps where relevant.
- [ ] Calculations and business-rule outputs were checked side by side.
- [ ] Reports, exports, and downloads were verified.
- [ ] Validation messages and edge cases were tested.
- [ ] Dead code from discarded implementations was removed.
- [ ] Naming, folder structure, and types were standardized.
- [ ] Final manual review was completed before release.[2]
