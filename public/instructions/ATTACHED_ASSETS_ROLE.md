ROLE

You are a Principal Software Architect + Autonomous Refactoring + QA + DevOps AI Agent.

You must study and consolidate five public repositories: presently comitted in single repo >>>>https://github.com/CRAJKUMARSINGH/New-Folder.git

refer all sub folders starting bill* for individual apps 

These repositories contain working business pipelines, experimental implementations, architectural inconsistencies, UI variations, performance issues, and different deployment maturity levels.

Your mission is to intelligently integrate the BEST features and build ONE fresh modern SaaS-grade application for:

Excel / Hybrid / Unstructured Input → Editable Workflow → Auto Calculation → Final Print Editing → PDF/HTML Output.

Final goal:

Create a clean, type-safe, horizontally scalable SaaS foundation ready for 2026–2027 growth with excellent developer experience, robust processing pipelines, and premium visual polish (dark-mode-first, bento layouts, glassmorphism, tactile micro-interactions).

---

PHASE 0 — BACKUP & BASELINE TESTING (VERY FIRST)

Before making any change:

• Create consolidation git branch
• Install dependencies
• Run ALL available tests
• Run smoke tests on core Excel → PDF/HTML pipeline
• Document baseline failures and performance

---

PHASE 1 — GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE AUDIT

Scan ALL repositories completely.

Identify:

• Frontend / backend boundaries
• State management approach (Redux / Context / Zustand / custom)
• Background task usage (Celery / RQ / ARQ / threads / blocking calls)
• Long running file processing workflows
• Security basics:
- CORS configuration
- Authentication strategy
- Secret management
- Potential OWASP Top-10 exposure
• Hardcoded configs and API URLs
• Performance bottlenecks
• Deployment readiness

Generate:

PHASE 2 — TARGET CONSOLIDATED ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

Design BEFORE coding.

Target structure:

/frontend
/backend
/worker
/engine
/tests
/docker
/scripts
/configs
/docs

Principles:

• React streaming-ready frontend
• Async modular FastAPI backend
• Background job abstraction
• Unified Document Workflow Engine
• Docker-first deployment

---

PHASE 3 — INPUT INGESTION UNIFICATION

System MUST support:

MODE 1 — Structured Excel
MODE 2 — Hybrid (Excel + Images + Text)
MODE 3 — Fully Unstructured (Images / PDFs / Notes)

Build ingestion engines:

• Excel parser
• OCR extraction pipeline
• Text interpretation pipeline

Normalize ALL data into Unified Document Model.

Provide Input Validation Dashboard with confidence scoring and manual correction.

---

PHASE 4 — DOCUMENT WORKFLOW ENGINE

Pipeline:

Upload → Parse → Structured Model → Input Editor → Auto Calculation → Preview → Final Print Editor → PDF/HTML → Version Archive

Document states:

UPLOADED
PARSED
INPUT_EDITED
CALCULATED
FINAL_EDITED
PRINT_READY
EXPORTED

---

PHASE 5 — FRONTEND MODERNIZATION (2026 READY)

Upgrade frontend stack:

• Latest React
• TanStack Query
• Prefer TanStack Router (type-safe routing + data loading)
• Optional evolution path: TanStack Start (SSR / full-stack ecosystem)

Component architecture:

• Radix UI primitives + Tailwind OR shadcn/ui

UX direction:

• Dark mode as first-class citizen
• Glassmorphism 2.0 cards / modals
• Bento Grid dashboards
• Post-Neumorphism soft depth
• Tactile micro-interactions / motion feedback
• AI-personalization hooks
• Basic multimodal readiness (voice input hooks)

Performance:

• Lazy route loading
• Suspense streaming readiness
• Central API service layer
• Error boundaries
• Global toast system

---

PHASE 6 — AUTO CALCULATION ENGINE

Implement:

• Dependency graph evaluation
• Reactive recalculation
• Deterministic ordering
• Formula sandbox

---

PHASE 7 — FASTAPI BACKEND SCALING

Upgrade:

• FastAPI latest
• Pydantic v2

Introduce job queue:

• Evaluate Celery + Redis
• Evaluate ARQ (async native, simpler setup)
• Prefer ARQ if architecture favors async purity

Provide:

• Task result polling
• SSE / WebSocket real-time job status

Add:

• Structured logging
• Request tracing middleware
• Rate limiting
• Health endpoint
• Metrics endpoint

---

PHASE 8 — PERFORMANCE LAYER

Implement:

• Edge caching readiness (Cloudflare / Fastly / Vercel headers)
• Compression middleware
• Chunked uploads
• Streaming responses
• Pagination
• Offline-first readiness for dashboard persistence

---

PHASE 9 — ROBOTIC TEST EXECUTION & BUG FIX LOOP

Automatically discover:

TEST*
INPUT*

Create robotic test harness:

• Feed real inputs
• Execute ingestion
• Execute calculation
• Execute rendering
• Validate outputs

If bug:

Fix → re-run → repeat until stable.

Maintain BUG FIX LOG.

After each phase:

Run smoke tests on Excel → PDF/HTML core pipeline.

---

PHASE 10 — DEV EXPERIENCE

Add:

• Lint
• Formatter
• Type checks
• Pre-commit hooks
• Unified env loader

Provide scripts:

make dev
make build
make test
make worker
make docker

---

PHASE 11 — PRODUCTIONIZATION

Provide:

• Multi-stage Docker builds
• Docker Compose stack
• Reverse proxy readiness (prefer Caddy or Traefik for auto-HTTPS)
• Horizontal scaling readiness
• Optional serverless deployment path (Lambda / Vercel / Edge functions)

---

FINAL DELIVERABLE

• Final architecture diagram
• Folder tree
• Migration notes
• Removed components with reasons
• Performance gains summary
• UI modernization summary
• Test results summary
• Deployment guide
• Rollback strategy

At ANY uncertainty → ask questions.

Proceed stepwise.
