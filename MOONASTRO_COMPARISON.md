### MoonAstro's Transit Approach

Based on their [Transit Gochar Report page](https://www.moonastro.com/astrology/transit%20gochor%20report.aspx):

1. **Philosophy**: Transit results vary person-to-person based on natal Moon position
2. **Planet Importance Hierarchy**:
   - Jupiter: Most influential (heaviest planet)
   - Saturn: Second most important (2.5 years per sign, causes Sade Sati)
   - Sun, Mars, Venus: Moderate importance
   - Mercury, Moon: Least important (not given much emphasis)
3. **Key Focus**: Jupiter and Saturn transits
4. **Sade Sati**: Special emphasis when Saturn transits through Moon sign
