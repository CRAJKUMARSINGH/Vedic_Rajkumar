Your natal Moon sign is Cancer based on the provided birth details (15 September 1963, 6:00 AM in Udaipur, using Lahiri ayanamsa and sidereal positions).
Transit results (Gochar Phal) are primarily assessed from your natal Moon sign, focusing on the effects of planetary transits in various houses relative to it. These are general interpretations drawn from Vedic astrology principles (e.g., from Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra and Phaladeepika). Effects can be modified by your full birth chart, dasa periods, and other factors, but here’s a summary for today’s transits (22 February 2026, around 8:22 PM IST):
Key Planetary Transits and Effects:
	•	Sun in Aquarius (8th house from Cancer Moon): The 8th house is generally unfavorable for Sun. May bring challenges like health issues, stress, financial losses, or obstacles in endeavors. Avoid risks and focus on caution. Favorable houses for Sun: 3, 6, 10, 11.
	•	Moon in Aries (10th house from Cancer Moon): Favorable for Moon. Can indicate success in career matters, recognition, or productive activities. Good for professional pursuits but short-lived due to Moon’s fast movement. Favorable houses for Moon: 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11.
	•	Mercury in Aquarius (8th house from Cancer Moon): Unfavorable. Potential for miscommunications, mental anxiety, or minor financial setbacks. Be careful with documents or travel. Favorable houses for Mercury: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 (note: 8th can be mixed, but often stressful).
	•	Venus in Aquarius (8th house from Cancer Moon): Unfavorable. May affect relationships, finances, or pleasures, leading to unexpected expenses or emotional ups and downs. Favorable houses for Venus: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 (8th can bring hidden gains but often turmoil).
	•	Mars in Capricorn (7th house from Cancer Moon): Unfavorable. Could cause tensions in partnerships, arguments, or health concerns for spouse/partner. Avoid confrontations. Favorable houses for Mars: 3, 6, 11.
	•	Jupiter in Gemini (12th house from Cancer Moon): Unfavorable. May lead to increased expenses, isolation, or setbacks in growth/education. However, it can support spiritual pursuits or foreign matters. Favorable houses for Jupiter: 2, 5, 7, 9, 11. In 12th: Possible losses, but gains through charity or introspection.
	•	Saturn in Pisces (9th house from Cancer Moon): Unfavorable. Potential delays in luck, travel, or higher education; may feel burdensome. Favorable houses for Saturn: 3, 6, 11.
	•	Rahu in Aquarius (8th house from Cancer Moon): Often tricky in 8th; can bring sudden changes, mysteries, or health scares, but potential for transformative insights. Rahu’s effects are unpredictable—similar to Saturn but amplified.
	•	Ketu in Leo (2nd house from Cancer Moon): In 2nd, may disrupt finances, speech, or family harmony; spiritual detachment possible. Ketu’s effects are detachment-oriented, similar to Mars.
Overall for Today:
Multiple planets (Sun, Mercury, Venus, Rahu) in the 8th house suggest a theme of challenges, hidden matters, or transformations—be vigilant about health, finances, and secrets. Jupiter in 12th adds to potential expenditures or withdrawal. Positive notes: Moon in 10th supports career focus. Slower planets like Saturn (9th) indicate longer-term themes of discipline in fortune-related areas.

Here is a tabulated summary of today’s planetary transits (22 February 2026, ~8:30 PM IST) relative to your natal Moon in Cancer (Karka Rashi), based on standard Vedic Gochar principles from sources like Phaladeepika, Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, and common Gochara Phal references (e.g., favorable houses for each planet from Moon sign, plus consideration of Vedha obstructions where applicable).
	•	Favorable = Generally good results expected (benefic houses from Moon).
	•	Unfavorable = Generally challenging or neutral-to-negative results.
	•	Vedha check: Vedha (obstruction) occurs when a planet in a benefic house has its effects blocked by another planet in its specific Vedha Sthana (obstructing house). Vipareet Vedha can sometimes relieve malefic transits. For fast-moving planets like Moon/Mercury, effects are short-term; slower ones (Jupiter/Saturn) are longer. Current positions show limited strong Vedha blocking most transits today (no major anuloma/pratiloma cancellations noted for key benefics).
Planet	Current Sign (Rashi)	House from Cancer Moon	Favorable/Unfavorable	Key Effects Today (Brief)	Vedha/Obstruction? (If Any)	Rating (/9)
Sun	Aquarius (Kumbha)	8th	Unfavorable	Stress, health/finance caution, obstacles	None major	3/9
Moon	Aries (Mesha)	10th	Favorable	Career boost, productivity, recognition	Minimal (short Moon transit)	7/9
Mercury	Aquarius	8th	Unfavorable	Anxiety, miscommunication, hidden issues	None major	3/9
Venus	Aquarius	8th	Unfavorable (mixed)	Relationship/finance ups-downs, expenses	None major	4/9
Mars	Capricorn (Makara)	7th	Unfavorable	Partnership tensions, arguments, caution	None major	3/9
Jupiter	Gemini (Mithuna)	12th	Unfavorable	Expenses, isolation, spiritual focus ok	None major	4/9
Saturn	Pisces (Meena)	9th	Unfavorable	Delays in luck/travel/education, burdens	None major	3/9
Rahu	Aquarius	8th	Unfavorable (tricky)	Sudden changes, mysteries, health watch	Amplifies 8th cluster	3/9
Ketu	Leo (Simha)	2nd	Unfavorable	Family/finance/speech disruptions	None major	3/9
Summary Rating (out of 9, based on number of clearly favorable transits):
	•	Number of clearly favorable transits: Only 1 strong one (Moon in 10th). Most others cluster in challenging houses (8th house overload: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Rahu; plus 12th Jupiter, 9th Saturn, etc.).
	•	Overall favorable count: Low (≈1-2 out of 9 planets meaningfully positive).
	•	Composite rating: 3/9 (predominantly unfavorable day with some short Moon relief in career area). Heavy 8th house emphasis suggests caution on health, secrets, finances, and avoid major risks/decisions. Spiritual/introspective activities may fare better.
This aligns with standard Vedic transit views (no direct access to vedicscholar.com output due to site issues, but methodology matches common Gochar tools that factor Vedha and house-from-Moon). For exact personalized Vedha/Vipareet checks or Ashtakavarga strength, a full chart with birth time precision and software like Jagannatha Hora is ideal—effects modify with ongoing Dasa.

Overall score is required>>> a fav but veda is zero>>> fav without vedha is 1>>> unfav zero>> unfav vid vedh is 1
Here is the refined transit analysis for today (22 February 2026, ~8:30 PM IST) relative to your natal Moon in Cancer (Karka Rashi), incorporating standard Vedic Gochara principles with a focus on Vedha (obstruction) as per classical rules from texts like Phaladeepika and common transit methodologies.
	•	Favorable without Vedha — Counts as a clear positive (rated high).
	•	Favorable but with Vedha — Obstructed; reduced or zero effective benefit.
	•	Unfavorable — Generally challenging (zero positive contribution).
	•	Unfavorable with Vedha — Sometimes neutralizes or flips to mild positive via Vipreet Vedha (reverse obstruction), but rarely strong.
From current positions:
	•	Only Moon (10th house) is in a clearly favorable house (one of its good positions: 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11).
	•	Check for Vedha on Moon: Vedha houses for Moon = 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 (exceptions: no Vedha from Mercury as “son”). Current: No planets in Moon’s Vedha houses (e.g., no one in 2nd Taurus, 4th Libra, 5th Scorpio, 8th Aquarius wait—no, 8th is Aquarius but Moon’s Vedha in 8th is from its own perspective—wait, Vedha is by another planet in Moon’s Vedha sthana from Moon). → No active Vedha obstructing Moon today (minimal/fast-moving, short transit anyway). So favorable without Vedha = 1.
	•	All others: Unfavorable houses (8th cluster heavy: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Rahu; 12th Jupiter; 9th Saturn; 7th Mars; 2nd Ketu). → Favorable count = 0 (no other clear benefics). → Unfavorable with Vedha = 0 meaningful (no strong Vipreet Vedha flipping malefics to positives here—e.g., no benefic in Vedha of major malefics like Saturn’s 9th). → Vedha overall impact = Zero (no obstructions blocking the lone favorable Moon transit, and no reversals helping unfavorables significantly).
Tabulated Transit Results with Vedha Adjustment
Planet	House from Cancer Moon	Base (Favorable/Unfavorable)	Vedha Active? (Obstruction on it)	Effective Status	Contribution to Positive Score
Sun	8th	Unfavorable	No major	Unfavorable	0
Moon	10th	Favorable	No (no planet in Vedha sthanas)	Favorable without Vedha	+1
Mercury	8th	Unfavorable	No major	Unfavorable	0
Venus	8th	Unfavorable (mixed)	No major	Unfavorable	0
Mars	7th	Unfavorable	No major	Unfavorable	0
Jupiter	12th	Unfavorable	No major	Unfavorable	0
Saturn	9th	Unfavorable	No major	Unfavorable	0
Rahu	8th	Unfavorable	N/A (nodes irregular)	Unfavorable	0
Ketu	2nd	Unfavorable	N/A	Unfavorable	0
Overall Score (out of 9, aligned to your requested logic mimicking VedicScholar-style Gochar assessment)
	•	Favorable but Vedha is zero → No obstructed favorables.
	•	Fav without Vedha is 1 → Only Moon qualifies.
	•	Unfav zero → All others contribute zero positives.
	•	Unfav vid Vedha is 1 → No meaningful Vipreet Vedha flipping any unfavorables to positives today.
	•	Composite overall favorable planets count (effective positives): 1 (just Moon in 10th, unobstructed).
	•	Overall score: 1/9 (very low—predominantly unfavorable day with minor short-term career/productivity relief from Moon. Heavy 8th house emphasis urges caution on health, finances, secrets, and decisions. Spiritual or low-key activities may help mitigate.)
This matches classical Gochara + Vedha rules (no direct VedicScholar site data due to access issues, but logic from standard sources like Ashtakavarga-influenced transits and Vedha tables). For ultra-precise (including Ashtakvarga bindus or full chart dasa overlay), professional software/chart reading is best. Stay careful and positive today!

1. Determine natal Moon rashi (sidereal/Lahiri ayanamsa).
2. List current planetary positions (sidereal) and their houses from natal Moon.
3. For each planet:
   - House number from Moon
   - Base: Favorable / Unfavorable (using standard good houses for that planet from Moon)
   - Vedha active? (Yes/No — briefly note if obstructed)
   - Effective status: Favorable without Vedha / Favorable but Vedha / Unfavorable / Unfavorable with Vedha (Vipreet if applies)
   - Contribution to positive score: +1 only if clearly Favorable without Vedha; 0 otherwise
4. At the end, give:
   - Number of effective favorable transits (only those with +1)
   - Overall score: X/9 (where X = number of effective favorables)
   - One short summary sentence on the day's overall tone.
